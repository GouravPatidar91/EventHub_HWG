The GitHub page for `EventHub_HWG` seems temporarily inaccessible, so I can‚Äôt pull live data from it right now. However, I can still create a **detailed, visually engaging, and well-organized `README.md`** template based on a typical event management app built with modern tools.

If you'd like to later refine this with actual repo content (like specific tech stack or screenshots), just let me know or re-share access.

### ‚úÖ Here's an upgraded `README.md` template:
